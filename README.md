# HistoryWorld

The aim of this site is to allow a user to scroll through history. As they do interesting topics will come up which will have a selection of videos attached and quizzes to attempt.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

## Current Data

I aim to build the framework for the site before adding too much content. To see the functionality select the "War" category and scroll to 1300AD. The crusades topic should pop up on the map.
